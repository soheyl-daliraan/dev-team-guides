# Why I am writing here?

I have been part of 4 early stage startup or software development teams in the intial stages. Unfortunatly some of them didn't suceed and some of them succeeded to some extent.
I had the idea to write my experiences in here. Of course they are not perfect and they are not the best ideas but they have been tested in real teams. I have also written my experience which didn't work out and why I think they failed in retrospective.
I ask you to also write your experience and what you think would be a better solution. With this I hope we will have a comprehensive set of ideas and guidlines on how to manage a software dev team.
My main focus is early stage teams. By early stage I mean startups or software development companies which have been working for less than 3 years or have at max 20 developers. This is my focus because I only have experinece in this companies.
