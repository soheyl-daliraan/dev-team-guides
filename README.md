# Why I am writing here?

I have been part of 4 early stage startup or software development teams in the intial stages. Unfortunatly some of them didn't suceed and some of them succeeded to some extent.
I had the idea to write my experiences in here. Of course they are not perfect and they are not the best ideas but they have been tested in real teams. I have also written my experience which didn't work out and why I think they failed in retrospective.
I ask you to also write your experience and what you think would be a better solution. With this I hope we will have a comprehensive set of ideas and guidlines on how to manage a software dev team.
My main focus is early stage teams. By early stage I mean startups or software development companies which have been working for less than 3 years or have at max 20 developers. This is my focus because I only have experinece in this companies.


# Team Structure


# Nowadays it is common to use SCRUM in manay software development teams.
But sometime's SCRUM practices are not going to help us have the best scenarios.

# Why some startups fail?
many reason could be named but time estimation and running out of budget is one of them.
So my idea is to help the development teams to have better estimations before starting to work on an idea.
