# Is SCRUM always the solution?
## When SCRUM is not going to work


Having a software development methodology is always helpful. At least it is going to give us some guidelines on how to manage the team and tasks.

In my opinion the most important aspects which the project managers are looking for is tracking the project progress.

The main goal is to know about project progress in any given time. The managers want to get some idea on project progress with a glance on the SCRUM board.

On the other side the developers want to have a way which know exactly the tasks and what should be done and also have the option to express their opinions on the task details and estimation.

I think if you can have these two sides of the story, in many cases it is going to be enough. SCRUM is giving us the framework to cover both party's needs and much more.

But some overheads are always coming when tring to adpapt SCRUM which is usually makes the team to leave some guidelines entierly.

I think adapting a methodology should not have the cost of losing the project management
