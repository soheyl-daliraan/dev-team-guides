# Senior Developers will lose interest in your company much faster


When you are working with a senior developer, you have the chance of adding brand new knowledge and experience to your team.

Senior developer usually brings years of expereince with him, which will give the team more confidence on working on new challenges.

The main challenge when working with senior developers is how to hold them in your company.

The vision of senior developers usually is not learning, which will take away a lot of inital motivations which junior developers have, but each of them individually look for something.

In my case the main motivations were asking for company stock, asking for a really high salary, a chance for relocation to countries with better quality of life.

These are the things which lots of companies usaully can not provide. Especially if you are an early stage company which doesn really have an employer brand.

So how should you attract senior developers and does it really make sense to work with them?

Since time is the most important thing when working on a startup, having a senior developer on board is definitely going to be paid off. Starting to work with juniors is going to cost you more time and not having the best results. So in my opinion, it is better to work with senior developers on hourly contract or as part time for building the team and use their expertise and connections to setup the tools and technologies. And in paralled look for less experienced developer with shorter list of demands, and ask your senior team member to help you on training the new members.

When your company grows over time you will going to have the chance to hire senior developers, because then you have another thing to offer, a new shiny experience on their already shiny resume.
